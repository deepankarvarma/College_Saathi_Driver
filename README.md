# College Saathi Driver App

Welcome to the College Saathi Driver App repository! This Flutter-based, cross-platform application empowers drivers to efficiently manage e-rickshaw ride requests within the campus. The app utilizes GetX for state management, Flutter for dynamic UI, and Firebase as a Backend as a Service (BaaS) to handle authentication, real-time communication, and ride history.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform and Dynamic:** This app is developed using Flutter, making it cross-platform, allowing drivers to provide a consistent experience on both Android and iOS devices. The dynamic UI enhances user engagement and responsiveness.

- **Dual Theme Support:** The app offers both light and dark mode themes, ensuring a visually appealing experience for drivers in different environments.

- **Authentication:** Robust email validation and authentication methods are implemented to ensure secure access for drivers.

- **Campus Information:** Access details about college events, important contacts, and various vendor information right from the app.

- **Ride Management:** Drivers receive ride requests from riders and can accept or reject them based on their availability and preference.

- **Real-time Communication:** Once a ride request is accepted, drivers and riders can view each other's details, facilitating a smooth pick-up process.

- **Ride History:** Completed rides are recorded in the ride history, providing drivers with a comprehensive overview of their completed trips.

- **Payment Integration (Under Development):** Payment methods are being added to enhance the driver's experience and provide a seamless transaction process.

- **Corner Case Handling:** Various edge cases are considered, such as ensuring that only one driver can accept a particular request.
